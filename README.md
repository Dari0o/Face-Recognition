# Face-Recognition

!!!IMPORTANT!!! You need to change the path at the top of the code to where the .xml file is locatet!

This program accesses the camera and saves a video. The recording of the old video file will stop and a new recording will start. I added this feature so there wont be one big video file.

It detects frontal faces and takes a screenshot of the face only and saves it in an extra folder.

Programm can be closed by pressing "q"


I use it on my raspberry pi 4 with 2 gb ram and it works great. I also use a camera modell wich can change between normal recording and infrared.
